These institutions are often described as  , although several authors have defined them more specifically as distinct institutions based on non-hierarchical or  . Anarchism\\'s central disagreement with other ideologies is that it holds the   to be undesirable, unnecessary, and harmful.  Anarchism is usually placed on the   of the  , and much of its   and   reflect   of  ,  ,  ,  , or  . As anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular worldview, many   exist and varieties of anarchy diverge widely.   can differ fundamentally, supporting anything from extreme   to complete  . Strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of   and  , or similar dual classifications.  == Etymology, terminology, and definition ==   The etymological origin of the word anarchism is from the ancient Greek word \\'\\'anarkhia\\'\\',  meaning \"without a ruler\", composed of the prefix \\'\\'a-\\'\\' (i.e. \"without\") and the word \\'\\'arkhos\\'\\' (i.e. \"leader\" or \"ruler\"). The suffix   denotes the ideological current that favours anarchy. The word anarchism appears in English from 1642 as \\'\\'anarchisme\\'\\' and the word \\'\\'anarchy\\'\\' from 1539. Various factions within the   labelled their opponents as anarchists, although few such accused shared many views with later anarchists. Many revolutionaries of the 19th century such as   (1756–1836) and   (1808–1871) would contribute to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation, but they did not use the word anarchist or anarchism in describing themselves or their beliefs.  The first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist () was   (1809–1865), marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid-19th century. Since the 1890s and beginning in France, the term   has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and its use as a synonym is still common outside the United States. On the other hand, some use libertarianism to refer to   only, referring to   as libertarian anarchism.  While   is central to anarchist thought, defining anarchism is not an easy task as there is a lot of talk among scholars and anarchists on the matter and various currents perceive anarchism slightly differently. Hence, it might be true to say that anarchism is a cluster of political philosophies opposing   and   (including the  ,  ,   and all associated  s) in the conduct of all   in favour of a society based on  , on   and on  , but this definition has the same shortcomings as the definition based on etymology (which is simply a negation of a ruler), or based on anti-statism (anarchism is much more than that) or even the anti-authoritarian (which is an \\'\\'a posteriori\\'\\' conclusion).  Nonetheless, major elements of the definition of anarchism include the following: # The will for a non-coercive society. # The rejection of the state apparatus. # The belief that human nature allows humans to exist in or progress toward such a non-coercive society. # A suggestion on how to act to pursue the ideal of  .  == History ==   ===Prehistoric and ancient world=== During the prehistoric era of mankind, an established authority did not exist. It was after the creation of towns and cities that institutions of authority were established and anarchistic ideas espoused as a reaction. Most notable precursors to anarchism in the ancient world were in   and  . In China,   was delineated by     and  . Likewise in Greece, anarchic attitudes were articulated by tragedians and philosophers.   and   used the myth of   to illustrate the conflict between rules set by the state and  .   questioned Athenian authorities constantly and insisted to the right of individual freedom of consciousness.   dismissed human law (\\'\\'nomos\\'\\') and associated authorities while trying to live according to nature (\\'\\'physis\\'\\').   were supportive of a society based on unofficial and friendly relations among its citizens without the presence of a state.  During the  , there was no anarchistic activity except some ascetic religious movements in the Islamic world or in Christian Europe. This kind of tradition later gave birth to  . In Persia,   called for an   and the  , only to be soon executed by the king. In  , religious sects preached against the state. In Europe, various sects developed anti-state and libertarian tendencies. Libertarian ideas further emerged during the   with the spread of   and   through Europe. Novelists fictionalised ideal societies that were based not on coercion but voluntarism. The   further pushed towards anarchism with the optimism for social progress.  === Modern era === The turning point towards anarchism was the   in which the anti-state and federalist sentiments began to take a form, mostly by   and \\'\\' \\'\\'. Some prominent figures of anarchism begun developing the first anarchist currents. This era of classical anarchism lasted until the end of the Spanish Civil War of 1936 and is considered the golden age of anarchism.   espoused   in England morally delegitimizing the state,  \\'s thinking paved the way to individualism and  \\'s theory of   found fertile soil in France.    took mutualism and extended it to  . Bakunin\\'s current ( ) entered the  , a class worker union later known as the First International that formed in 1864 to unite diverse revolutionary currents. The International became a significant organisation, and   a leading figure and a member of its General Council. Proudhon\\'s followers, the  , opposed Marx\\'s  , advocating political   and small property holdings. Bakunin\\'s followers entered a bitter dispute with Marx which ended in 1872 with the split of the workers movement that officially took place in  . Marx advocating the creation of a political party to take part in electoral struggles which Bakunin strongly rejected. Bakunin famously predicted that if such a party would gain power by Marxist\\'s terms, it would end up as the new tyrant of workers. After being expelled, anarchists formed the  . Under the influence of  , a Russian philosopher and scientist,   overlapped with collectivism. Anarcho-communists, who drew inspiration from the 1871  , advocated for free federation and distribution of goods according to one needs.  At the turning of the century, anarchism had spread all over the world. In China, small groups of students imported the humanistic pro-science version of anarcho-communism. Tokyo was a hotspot for rebellious youth from countries of the far east, pouring into the Japanese capital to study. In  ,   was a stronghold and anarcho-syndicalism was the most prominent left-wing ideology. During this time, a minority of anarchists embarked upon violent means to achieve political ends. This strategy became known as  . The dismemberment of the French socialist movement into many groups and the execution and exile of many   to penal colonies following the suppression of the Paris Commune favoured individualist political expression and acts. Even though many anarchists distanced themselves from these terrorist acts, infamy came upon the movement.   was another strategy which some anarchists adopted these same years.  Anarchists enthusiastically participated in the  —despite concern—in opposition to the  . However, they met harsh suppression after the   was stabilized. Several anarchists from Petrograd and Moscow fled to Ukraine, notably leading to the   and  \\'s struggle in the  . With the anarchists being crushed in Russia, two new antithetical currents emerged, namely   and  . Platformists sought to create a coherent group that would push for the revolution while the latter were against anything that would resemble a political party. The victory of the Bolsheviks in the   and the resulting   did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally—where many workers and activists saw the Bolshevik success as setting an example and   grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the United States, members of major syndicalist movements, the   and  , left the organisations and joined the  .  In the  , anarchists and syndicalists (  and  ) once again allied themselves with various currents of leftists. Spain had a long   and anarchists played an important role in the war. In response to the army rebellion, an anarchist-inspired movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of   and of large areas of rural Spain where they   the land. The Soviet Union provided some limited assistance at the beginning of the war, but the result was a bitter fight among communists and anarchists at a series of events named   as   tried to seize control of the  .  === Post-war era === At the end of World War II, the anarchist movement was severely weakened. However, the 1960s witnessed a revival of anarchism likely caused by a perceived failure of   and tensions built by the  . During this time, anarchism took root in other movements critical to both the state and capitalism such as the  ,   and  , the  , and the  . Anarchism became associated with   as exemplified by bands such as   and the  , and the established   tendencies of   returned with vigour during the  .  Around the turn of the 21st century, anarchism grew in popularity and influence within  ,   and  s. Anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the  ,   and  . During the protests, \\'\\'ad hoc\\'\\' leaderless anonymous cadres known as  s engaged in  ing,   and violent confrontations with the  . Other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include  ,  s and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet. A significant event of this period was the confrontations at the  . Anarchist ideas have been influential in the development of the   in Mexico, and the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria, more commonly known as  , a \\'\\'de facto\\'\\'   in northern  .  == Anarchist schools of thought ==     had been generally grouped in two main historical traditions (  and  ) which have some different origins, values and evolution. The individualist wing of anarchism emphasises   (opposition to state or   over the individual) while those in the social wing emphasise   to achieve one\\'s potential and argue that humans have needs that society ought to fulfil, \"recognising equality of entitlement\". In a chronological and theoretical sense, there are classical—those created throughout the 19th century—and post-classical anarchist schools—those created since the mid-20th century and after.  Beyond the specific factions of anarchist thought is   which is the theoretical stance that the state lacks moral legitimacy without accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it. A component especially of individualist anarchism, philosophical anarchism may accept the existence of a   as an unfortunate and usually temporary, necessary evil, but argue that citizens do not have a   to obey the state when its laws conflict with individual autonomy. One reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was  , a call for   first adopted by   in 1889 in response to the bitter debates of anarchist theory at the time. In abandoning the hyphenated anarchisms (i.e. collectivist-, communist-, mutualist- and individualist-anarchism), it sought to emphasise the   beliefs common to all anarchist schools of thought. The various anarchist schools of thought or currents are not distinct entities, but intermingle with each other.  === Classical ===   and   anarchism and   are all considered to be forms of  .   and   were the other notable anarchist currents through the 19th and early 20th century. Social anarchism rejects  , seeing it as a source of social inequality (while retaining respect for  ) and emphasises   and  .  ==== Mutualism ====    began in 18th-century English and French labour movements before taking an anarchist form associated with   in France and others in the United States. Proudhon proposed spontaneous order, whereby organisation emerges without central authority, a \"positive anarchy\" where order arises when everybody does \"what he wishes and only what he wishes\" and where \"business transactions alone produce the social order\".  Proudhon distinguished between ideal political possibilities and practical governance. For this reason, much in contrast to some of his theoretical statements concerning ultimate spontaneous self-governance, Proudhon was heavily involved in French parliamentary politics and allied himself with the socialist factions of the workers movement. During his life of public service, he began advocating state-protected  s for worker-owned  s and promoting certain   schemes.  Mutualist anarchism is concerned with  ,  , voluntary  ,   and  . According to the American mutualist  , each worker in the mutualist system would receive \"just and exact pay for his work; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost, without profit or discount\". Mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism. Proudhon first characterised his goal as a \"third form of society, the synthesis of communism and property [which] we call LIBERTY\".  ==== Collectivist anarchism ====   , also known as anarchist collectivism or anarcho-collectivism and referred to as revolutionary socialism or a  , is a revolutionary form of anarchism commonly associated with   and  .  At the epicentre of collectivist anarchism lies the belief in the potential of humankind for goodness and solidarity which will flourish when oppressive governments are abolished. Collectivist anarchists oppose all private ownership of the means of production, instead advocating that ownership be collectivised. This was to be achieved through violent revolution, first starting with a small cohesive group through acts of violence, or propaganda by the deed, to inspire the workers as a whole to revolt and forcibly collectivise the means of production. However, collectivisation was not to be extended to the distribution of income as workers would be paid according to time worked, rather than receiving goods being distributed according to need as in anarcho-communism. This position was criticised by anarcho-communists as effectively \"uphold[ing] the wages system\". Collectivist anarchism arose contemporaneously with  , but it opposed the Marxist   despite the stated Marxist goal of a collectivist  .  Anarchist, communist and collectivist ideas are not  —although the collectivist anarchists advocated  , some held out the possibility of a post-revolutionary transition to a communist system of distribution according to need.  ==== Anarcho-communism ====    , also known as  ,   and  , is a theory of anarchism that advocates abolition of the  ,  ,  ,   (while retaining respect for  ) and   in favour of   of the  ,   and a   of  s and  s with production and consumption based on the guiding principle: \" \".  Anarcho-communism developed out of radical socialist currents after the  , but it was first formulated as such in the Italian section of the  . The theoretical work of   took importance later as it expanded and developed pro-organisationalist and insurrectionary anti-organisationalist sections.  To date, the best known examples of an anarcho-communist society (i.e. established around the ideas as they exist today and achieving worldwide attention and knowledge in the historical canon), are the anarchist territories during the   and the   during the  . Through the efforts and influence of the   during the Spanish Revolution within the   starting in 1936, anarcho-communism existed in most of Aragon, parts of the Levante and Andalusia as well as in the stronghold of  . Along with the  , it was crushed by the combined forces of the  \\'s  ,   and   as well as repression by the   (backed by the  ) and economic and armaments blockades from the capitalist countries and the   itself.  ==== Anarcho-syndicalism ====    , also referred to as revolutionary syndicalism, is a branch of anarchism that focuses on the  .  Anarcho-syndicalists view labour unions as a potential force for revolutionary social change, replacing capitalism and the state with a new society democratically self-managed by workers. The basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are workers\\'  ,   and  . Anarcho-syndicalists believe that only direct action—that is, action concentrated on directly attaining a goal as opposed to indirect action such as electing a representative to a government position—will allow workers to liberate themselves.  Moreover, anarcho-syndicalists believe that workers\\' organisations (the organisations that struggle against the wage system which in anarcho-syndicalist theory will eventually form the basis of a new society) should be self-managing. They should not have bosses or business agents—rather, the workers should be able to make all the decisions that affect them themselves.   was one of the most popular voices in the anarcho-syndicalist movement. He outlined a view of the origins of the movement, what it sought and why it was important to the future of labour in his 1938 pamphlet \\'\\'Anarcho-Syndicalism\\'\\'. The   is an international anarcho-syndicalist federation of various labour unions from different countries. The Spanish   played and still plays a major role in the Spanish labour movement. It was also an important force in the Spanish Civil War.  ==== Individualist anarchism ====    refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasise the   and their   over any kinds of external determinants such as groups, society, traditions and ideological systems. Individualist anarchism is not a single philosophy, but it instead refers to a group of individualistic philosophies that sometimes are in conflict.  In 1793,  , who has often been cited as the first anarchist, wrote \\'\\' \\'\\', a book which some consider the first expression of anarchism. Godwin was a philosophical anarchist and from a   and   basis opposed revolutionary action and saw a   as a present \"necessary evil\" that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge. Godwin advocated individualism, proposing that all cooperation in labour be eliminated on the premise that this would be most conducive with the general good. An influential form of individualist anarchism called  , or  , was expounded by one of the earliest and best-known proponents of individualist anarchism, the German  . Stirner\\'s \\'\\' \\'\\', published in 1844, is a founding text of the philosophy. According to Stirner, the only limitation on the rights of individuals is their power to obtain what they desire without regard for God, state, or morality. To Stirner, rights were \" \" in the mind and he held that society does not exist, but \"the individuals are its reality\". Stirner advocated self-assertion and foresaw  , non-systematic associations continually renewed by all parties\\' support through an act of will, which Stirner proposed as a form of organisation in place of the state. Egoist anarchists argue that egoism will foster genuine and spontaneous union between individuals. \"Egoism\" has inspired many interpretations of Stirner\\'s philosophy. It was re-discovered and promoted by German philosophical anarchist and   activist  .    was a pioneer American anarcho-individualist, who drew inspiration from Proudhon.   (1817–1862) was an important early influence in individualist anarchist thought in the United States and Europe. Thoreau was an American author, poet, naturalist, tax resister,  , surveyor, historian, philosopher and leading  . He is best known for his books \\'\\' \\'\\', a reflection upon   in natural surroundings, as well as his essay, \\'\\' \\'\\', an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state. Benjamin Tucker later fused Stirner\\'s egoism with the economics of Warren and Proudhon in his eclectic influential publication \\'\\' \\'\\'.  From these early influences, individualist anarchism in different countries attracted a small yet diverse following of Bohemian artists and intellectuals,   and   advocates (see  ), individualist  s and  s (see  ),   and   activists as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as illegalism and   (see   and  ). These authors and activists included  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   and  , among others.  === Post-classical and contemporary ===  Anarchist principles undergird contemporary radical social movements of the left. Interest in the anarchist movement developed alongside momentum in the  , whose leading activist networks were anarchist in orientation. As the movement shaped 21st century radicalism, wider embrace of anarchist principles signaled a revival of interest. Contemporary news coverage which emphasizes   demonstrations has reinforced anarchism\\'s historical association with chaos and violence, though its publicity has also led more scholars to engage with the anarchist movement. Anarchism continues to generate many philosophies and movements, at times eclectic, drawing upon various sources and  , combining disparate concepts to create new philosophical approaches.    stays prominent within contemporary anarchism, continuing the tradition of classical anarchism.     is a tendency that rejects violence in the struggle for social change (see  ). It developed mostly in the Netherlands, Britain and the United States before and during the Second World War.   is a   in   that combines anarchism and Christianity. Its main proponents included  ,  ,   and  .    is a recent branch of anarchism that takes traditional and modern anarchism, typically drawing from  ,  , or  , and combines it with   and  . It can be described as a \"liberal democratic revolution, at its core the idea that people are happiest when they have rational control over their lives. Reason, science, and technology provide one kind of control, slowly freeing us from ignorance, toil, pain, disease and limited lifespans (aging)\". Some anarcho-transhumanists might also follow  .   , or  , includes several branches of anarchism that advocate an economic system based on voluntary, market interactions without the involvement of the state. Certain individualist anarchists and mutualists supported this economic system.   is a modern branch of free-market anarchism which strongly affirm the   ideas of   and  s while maintaining that taken to their logical conclusions these ideas support strongly  ,  ,   and   positions in economics;   in foreign policy; and thoroughly radical views regarding cultural issues such as gender, sexuality and race.   , or  , is a school of thought within anarchism that emphasises environmental issues, with an important precedent in anarcho-naturism and whose main contemporary currents are anarcho-primitivism and  . Writing from a green anarchist perspective,   attributes the ills of today\\'s social degradation to technology and the birth of agricultural civilization. While   argues that \"the shift in human consciousness was also a shift in human subsistence strategies, whereby some human animals reinvented their narrative to center murder and predation and thereby institutionalize violence\". According to AbdelRahim,   was the result of the human development of technologies and grammar for predatory economics. Language and literacy, she claims, are some of these technologies.    is a revolutionary theory, practice and tendency within the anarchist movement which emphasises   within anarchist practice. Critical of formal organisations such as   and federations that are based on a political programme and periodic congresses, insurrectionary anarchists instead advocate informal organisation and small   based organisation as well as putting value in attack, permanent   and a refusal to negotiate or compromise with class enemies.    is a tendency within the wider anarchist movement based on the organisational theories in the tradition of Dielo Truda\\'s \\'\\'Organisational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft)\\'\\'. The document was based on the experiences of   in the 1917   which led eventually to the victory of the   over the anarchists and other groups. The \\'\\'Platform\\'\\' attempted to address and explain the anarchist movement\\'s failures during the  .    is a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and   thought, drawing from diverse ideas including post-left anarchy,  ,  ,   and the  .    is a recent current in anarchist thought that promotes a critique of anarchism\\'s relationship to traditional  . Some post-leftists seek to escape the confines of   in general also presenting a critique of organisations and  . Influenced by the work of Max Stirner and by the Marxist  , post-left anarchy is marked by a focus on social insurrection and a rejection of leftist social organisation.    is a theory that suggests anarchism as a solution to the issues faced by the  , mainly  ,  ,   and  . It arose during the late 20th century based on the work of  \\'s \\'\\' \\'\\' (1976).    refers to a set of related anarchist ideologies that are inspired by the teachings of  s. While many anarchists have traditionally been sceptical of and opposed to  , many different religions have served as inspiration for religious forms of anarchism, most notably   as   believe that biblical teachings give credence to anarchist philosophy. Other examples include  ,   and most recently  .    is a form of anarchism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives. In the 1920s, this form found as its main proponents the     and  . It is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global  .   ==== Anarcha-feminism ====   , also called   and  , combines anarchism with  . It generally views   as a manifestation of involuntary coercive hierarchy that should be replaced by   free association. Anarcha-feminists believe that the struggle against patriarchy is an essential part of   and the anarchist struggle against the state. In essence, the philosophy sees anarchist struggle as a necessary component of feminist struggle and vice versa. Anarcha-feminists espoused to a detailed analysis of patriarchy and claim that oppression has its roots to social norms.  Anarcha-feminism began with the late 19th-century writings of early feminist anarchists such as   and  .   was an anarchist women\\'s organisation in Spain that aimed to empower working class women, based on the idea of a double struggle for   and social revolution and argued that the two objectives were equally important and should be pursued in parallel. In order to gain mutual support, they created networks of women anarchists. The second wave of anarcha-feminism arose in the 1960s.  ==== Anarcho-capitalism ====    advocates the elimination of the state in favour of self-ownership in a free market. Anarcho-capitalism developed from radical American anti-state   and  , drawing from   economics, study of   and  . However, the overall consensus among anarchists believes that anarcho-capitalism cannot be considered a part of the anarchist movement due to the fact that anarchism has historically been an anti-capitalist movement which opposes private property over the means of production and for definitional reasons which see anarchism as   with capitalist forms.  == Internal issues and debates ==   As anarchism is a   that embodies many diverse attitudes, tendencies and schools of thought and disagreement over questions of values, ideology and tactics is common, its diversity has led to widely different use of identical terms among different anarchist traditions which has led to many  . For instance, the compatibility of  ,   and   with anarchism is widely disputed. Similarly, anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as  ,  ,   and  . Anarchists may be motivated by  ,  ,  ,  , or any number of alternative ethical doctrines. Phenomena such as  ,   (e.g. within  ) and the   may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others. On a tactical level,   was used by anarchists in the 19th century (e.g. the  ), with some contemporary anarchists espousing alternative direct action methods such as  ,   and   to bring about an anarchist society. About the scope of an anarchist society, some anarchists advocate a global one while others do so by local ones.  == Topics of interest == Intersecting and overlapping between various schools of thought, certain topics of interest and internal disputes have proven perennial within anarchist theory.  === Anarchism and free love ===   An important current within anarchism is  . In Europe, the main propagandist of free love within individualist anarchism was  . He proposed the concept of \\'\\'la camaraderie amoureuse\\'\\' to speak of free love as the possibility of voluntary sexual encounter between consenting adults. He was also a consistent proponent of  . In Germany, the   Adolf Brand and John Henry Mackay were pioneering campaigners for the acceptance of male   and  . More recently, the British anarcho-pacifist Alex Comfort gained notoriety during the   for writing the bestseller sex manual \\'\\' \\'\\'. The issue of free love has a dedicated treatment in the work of French anarcho-  philosopher   in such works as \\'\\'Théorie du corps amoureux. Pour une érotique solaire\\'\\' (2000) and \\'\\'L\\'invention du plaisir. Fragments cyréaniques\\'\\' (2002).  === Anarchism and education ===  English anarchist William Godwin considered education an important aspect. He was against state education as he considered those schools as a way of the state to replicate privileges of the ruling class. Godwin thought that education was the way to change the world. In his \\'\\' \\'\\', he criticises state sponsored schooling and advocates for child\\'s protection from coercion. Max Stirner wrote in 1842 a long essay on education called \\'\\' \\'\\' in which Stirner was advocating for child\\'s autonomy.  In 1901, Catalan anarchist and free thinker   established   or   in Barcelona in defiance of an educational system controlled by the Catholic Church. Ferrer\\'s approach was secular, rejecting both the state and church involvement in the educational process and gave pupils plenty of autonomy (i.e. on setting the curriculum). Ferrer was aiming to educate the working class. The school closed after constant harassment by the state and Ferrer was later on arrested. Ferrer\\'s ideas generally formed the inspiration for a series of   in the United States.  Russian Christian anarchist Leo Tolstoy established a school for peasant children on his estate. Tolstoy\\'s educational experiments were short-lived due to harassment by the Tsarist secret police. Tolstoy established a conceptual difference between education and culture. He thought that \"[e]ducation is the tendency of one man to make another just like himself. [...] Education is culture under restraint, culture is free. [Education is] when the teaching is forced upon the pupil, and when then instruction is exclusive, that is when only those subjects are taught which the educator regards as necessary\". For him, \"without compulsion, education was transformed into culture\".  A more recent libertarian tradition on education is that of   and the   in which child-led activity replaces pedagogic approaches. Experiments in Germany led to   founding what became   in 1921. Summerhill is often cited as an example of anarchism in practice. However, although Summerhill and other free schools are radically libertarian, they differ in principle from those of Ferrer by not advocating an overtly political class struggle-approach. In addition to organising schools according to libertarian principles, anarchists have also questioned the concept of schooling per se. The term   was popularised by  , who argued that the school as an institution is dysfunctional for self-determined learning and serves the creation of a consumer society instead.  === Anarchism and the state ===  Objection to the state and its institutions is \\'\\' \\'\\' of anarchism. Anarchists consider the state as a tool of domination and it is illegitimate regardless of political tendencies. Instead of people being able to control the aspects of their life, major decisions are taken by a small elite. Authority ultimately rests solely on power regardless if it is   or   as it still has the ability to coerce people. Another anarchist argument against states is that some people constituting a government, even the most altruistic among officials, will unavoidably seek to gain more power, leading to corruption. Anarchists consider the argument that the state is the collective will of people as a fairy tale since the   is distinct from the rest of the society.  === Anarchism and violence ===   Anarchist perspectives towards violence have always been perplexed and controversial. On one hand, anarcho-pacifists point out the unity of means and ends. On the other hand, other groups of anarchist are for direct action that can include sabotage or even terrorism.   and  , who were proponents of limited use of violence, were arguing that violence is merely a reaction to state violence as a  . Peace activist and anarchist   argues that violence is incompatible with anarchism because it is mostly associated with the state and authority as violence is immanent to the state. As the state\\'s capability to exercise violence is colossal nowadays, a rebellion or civil war would probably end in another authoritarian institute.  === Anarchist strategies and tactics === A broad categorization would be the preference of revolutionary tactics to destroy oppressive states and institutions or aiming to change society through evolutionary means. Revolutionary methods can take violent form as they did in past insurgencies (i.e. in Spain, Mexico and Russia) or during violent protests by militant protestors such as the  , who are generally much less violent than revolutionary movements a century ago. Anarchists also commonly employ   which can take the form of disrupting and protesting against unjust hierarchies, or the form of self-managing their lives through the creation of counterinstitutions such as communes and non-hierarchical collectives. Often decision-making is handled in an anti-authoritarian way, with everyone having equal say in each decision, an approach known as  . Another aspect of anarchist tactics is their aim to strengthen social bonds through common actions. Reclaiming public space by anarchists is another method of creating social spaces and creating squats in order to organise themselves. During important events such as protests and when spaces are being occupied, they are often called  s.  == Criticism == Moral and pragmatic criticism of anarchism includes allegations of utopianism, tacit authoritarianism and vandalism towards feats of civilisation.  === Allegation of utopianism === Anarchism is evaluated as unfeasible or   by its critics, often in general and formal debate. European history professor Carl Landauer argued that social anarchism is unrealistic and that government is a \"lesser evil\" than a society without \"repressive force\". He also argued that \"ill intentions will cease if repressive force disappears\" is an \"absurdity\". However, \\'\\' \\'\\' states the following: \"Anarchy is not a utopia, [and] anarchists make no such claims about human perfection. [...] Remaining disputes would be solved by reasonable methods, for example, the use of juries, mutual third parties, or community and workplace assemblies\". It also states that \"some sort of \\'court\\' system would still be necessary to deal with the remaining crimes and to adjudicate disputes between citizens\".  === Industrial civilisation === In his essay \\'\\'On Authority\\'\\',   claimed that radical   promoted by anarchists would destroy modern  , citing an example of  s and making the following point:   In the end, it is argued that authority in any form is a natural occurrence which should not be abolished.  === Tacit authoritarianism === The anarchist tendency known as   has been criticised by  ,  ,   and others of preserving tacitly statist, authoritarian or bureaucratic tendencies.  == List of anarchist societies ==   *   (Fejuve; 1979–present) *   (CIPO-RFM; 1980s–present) *   (2001–present) *   (2006–present) *   (2011–present) *   (Rojava; 2013–present)  == See also ==  *   *   *   *    == References == === Citations ===   === Sources === ; Primary sources  *  *  *  *  *  *  *   *    *  *  *  *    ; Secondary sources  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *   *   *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  |publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-20126-1|ref=harv}} *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * |publisher=Reaktion Books|location=London |date=1 June 2003|isbn=978-1-86189-169-3|ref=harv}} *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *    ; Tertiary sources  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * |access-date=28 February 2019}} *  *    == Further reading == *  *  *  *  *  *  *   == External links ==  * [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/ Anarchy Archives].   is an online research center on the history and theory of anarchism                                      '"
